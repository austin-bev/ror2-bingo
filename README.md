# Ror2 (Risk of Rain 2) Bingo Board Generator

Intended to be used with [Bingosync](https://bingosync.com/)

## Why not just create a Bingosync PR?

Bingosync is great but functionally all it does it pick randomly from a pool of objectives.
This project will randonly generate objectives from the item/equipment/enemy pools provided, leading to over 500+ possible squares.
This also allows more customization of the bingo board generated, including flags for turning off DLC items, allowing items, and changing the weights of objectives.
